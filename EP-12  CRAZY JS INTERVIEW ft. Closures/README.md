- data hiding/privacy, counter example
- wrap fn over it & return increment fn so it forms closure
- In constructor fn use new keyword
- overconsumptn of memory, not garbage collected, memory leak if not handled properly
- garbage collector freeze memory if it finds out it is no longer needed
- z is garbage collected if it is declared inside outer fn but not used
