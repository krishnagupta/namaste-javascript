- let & const declarations are hoisted
- let & cost are allocated memory but they r stored in different memory space than global
- u cant access before putting value to them
- it remains in temporal dead zone till(from hoisting) it is initialised
- syntax error (let a =5, let a = 6)
- type error (const b; b= 5)
- reference error (console.log(x); let x =5)
- best way to avoid temp dead zone, push dec and initlzn at top
